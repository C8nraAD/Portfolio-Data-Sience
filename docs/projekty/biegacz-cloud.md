# 🏃‍♂️ AI Half-Marathon Inference Engine & Pacing Assistant

[Live Deployment](https://whale-app-k2xqp.ondigitalocean.app) [Repository](https://github.com/C8nraAD/AI-Health-Advisor)

## 🎯 System Overview & Business Objective
An end-to-end predictive application estimating half-marathon completion times via a conversational UI. The system leverages an L2 regularized machine learning model trained on historical runner telemetry. Beyond inference, the engine generates customized, vectorized pacing profiles and integrates a monitored LLM for context-aware training recommendations.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Ecosystem
* **Frontend & State Management:** Streamlit (FSM-based dialogue orchestration).
* **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn` (Ridge Regression, Pipeline architecture).
* **Data Engineering & Computation:** `NumPy` (vectorization), `Pandas`.
* **Cloud Storage & MLOps:** AWS S3 / DigitalOcean Spaces (stateless artifact retrieval).
* **Generative AI & Observability:** OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini) + Langfuse (LLM telemetry).
* **Data Visualization:** Altair.

## 🏗 Key Architectural Decisions
The application is architected for low latency, stateless execution, and robust error handling:

1. **Vectorized Computation Engine (NumPy):** Eliminated native Python `for`-loops in favor of vectorized operations (`np.cumsum`, `np.interp`). This generates a 22-point cumulative pacing profile with strictly O(1) operations per array, aggressively minimizing computational overhead.
2. **Deterministic UI State Orchestration (FSM):** The conversational interface is strictly governed by a Finite State Machine. Pre-inference input sanitization is enforced via RegEx validators, preventing prompt injection and ensuring data integrity before the payload reaches the ML pipeline.
3. **Stateless Cloud-Native Design:** The application dynamically loads serialized model artifacts (`.pkl`) and aggregational reference data (`.csv`) directly from S3-compatible object storage. This decouples the codebase from heavy binary files and streamlines PaaS deployment.
4. **LLM Telemetry & Observability:** Implemented the `langfuse.openai` wrapper to establish comprehensive observability. This guarantees granular monitoring of token consumption, latency spikes, and log quality, critical for production-grade GenAI integration.

## 🧠 Predictive Model Architecture
Inference is driven by a robust, non-leaking data pipeline: `Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('ridge', Ridge())])`.

* **Training Corpus:** Aggregated and sanitized historical dataset (2023-2024) comprising N = 18,377 unique observations.
* **Cross-Validation Metrics (CV=5):**
    * **R² Score:** 0.9834 (capturing >98% of dataset variance).
    * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** ~54 seconds over a 21.0975 km distance.
* **Production Heuristics:** The deployed model intentionally broadens the confidence interval (±5 minutes) to account for stochastic variance introduced by subjective, user-reported feature inputs via the chat interface.
